## Introduction
This Rails-based site is designed to allow you and your friends to create a role-playing story together. Create an account (or log back in), create a story, or join a story already made! To ensure that your story is intruded upon, each story is made with a passcode, so your story stays your own. Have fun!

## Starting Out
To get this started, grab the code from https://github.com/ph3nomforko/storybuilder and run `bundle install`.

Once that finishes, run `rails s` from your terminal, and then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Now you can create an account, and create your first story or character!
